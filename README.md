# Chain-of-Responsibility
This code implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern for handling support tickets in a help desk ticketing system. It defines different handlers for basic, intermediate, and advanced support teams. Each handler checks if it can handle the ticket based on its priority level, and if not, passes it to the next handler in the chain. Finally, it tests the chain of responsibility by processing several support tickets with different priority levels.
